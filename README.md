## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was definitely more challenging in terms of layout than the other two I have completed already, and to be honest at first glance it was deceptively simple, but it led me to get more familiar still with flexbox. I mainly got to experience first hand how various different flexboxes interact with each other, how changing one positioning value might affect many others and the best ways to positon elements among more complicated arrangements. I also tried to follow some advice I got from my previous project and defined font-size in the custom properties, which made it easier to tweak the values in one place instead of having to jump all over the document.

### Continued development

I feel like perhaps the way I positioned the images in the background might not have been the most effective way, and perhaps I would have been better served using blend mode instead, so that is definitely something that I will be looking into going forward.
